# LCD Scanlines
Dynamic scanline generation for LCD

LCD Scanlines is an image upscaler that takes advantage of scanlines to increase 
resolution of images.

It demonstrates a dynamic scanline generation algorithm where brightness of each black 
line pixel is calculated by summing the illumination coming from adjacent active pixels. The 
resulting image is suitable for viewing on most flat-panel displays and high-resolution 
projectors.
